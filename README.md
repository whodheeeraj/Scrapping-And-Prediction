# Scrapping-And-Prediction
This is the Project of scrapping the data of a football league and Making a prediction model for it.

There are two .ipynb files, one for scrapping the data from web and other is for prediction. Sometimes it will take large amount of time then update the time to 2 seconds in both shooting and final time.
